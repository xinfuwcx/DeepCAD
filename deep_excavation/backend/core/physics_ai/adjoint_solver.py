    Solves the adjoint equation to enable efficient gradient computation.

    The adjoint method avoids the high cost of finite differences for large numbers
    of parameters. It computes the gradient of the objective function J with
    respect to the design parameters p at a cost nearly independent of the
    number of parameters.

    The core task is to solve the adjoint equation:
        R_u^T * lambda = -J_u^T
    where:
        R_u is the Jacobian of the PDE residual with respect to the state variables u.
        J_u is the gradient of the objective function with respect to u.
        lambda is the adjoint variable (the vector of Lagrange multipliers).
